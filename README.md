# ECE557 - Linear Control Theory

## Course Description
ECE557 is an in-depth course on linear control theory, covering various methods and applications of control systems engineering. This course includes a strong emphasis on both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 2
Analysis and design of control systems with an emphasis on frequency response methods. Students will engage in practical exercises involving system modeling and control design.

### Lab 3
Focuses on state-space methods and design for control systems. The lab involves hands-on applications using MATLAB for state estimation and feedback control.

### Lab 4
Addresses advanced topics in control theory, including robustness and optimization. Students will explore these concepts through simulations and real-world case studies.
